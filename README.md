# DL_project
This is the official repository for a Deep Learning project at DTU in the course Introduction to Deep Learning (02456). 
The project is based arround attempt tp simplify the Faster-RCNN framework that normally is trained on the VGG-16 pre-trianed convolutional network to a implementation on our own. This attempt is based on the hypothesis that our dataset that contains fewer classes than the data set that VGG-16 was originally trained on.

The dataset is a property of Hedia and can therefore not be shared here.
